I'm sure that one day we will look back on the likes of JQuery and many of big JS Frameworks in the same way/<br/><br/>The WiiSources project was designed to be playable on Nintendo Wii but also on computers. It was a series of games aimed at small children to improve hand-eye coordination.<br/><br/>The music finder app was built using Adobe Flex (Flash Builder). This technology allowed the front end web app to connect to da tabase and provide a rich user interface, back in the days before many of the big JS frameworks existed.<br/><br/>The Hartlepool Space to Learn site was built as a holding page for Hartlepool Council to advertise an upcoming learning building.<br/><br/>The Northern Grid Awards 2010 site was built to show the winners of the learning technology awards show. It was built as a single page application using JQuery. <br/><br/> Unfortunately these sites have served their purpose and are now offline. ",
