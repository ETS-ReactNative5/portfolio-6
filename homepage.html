        <p class="about_text">
            Hi, I am a Front End Web Developer based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. I graduated from Northumbria University in 2011 with first class honors and have been working on various projects since then. I specialise in working on large scale web applications in which I have used primarily JQuery and PHP. I also have experience in regular web pages and converting PSD images to HTML code.
